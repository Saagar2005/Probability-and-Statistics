# Birthday Paradox
Find the number of students in a class such that the probability that at least two students have the same birthday is greater than 'p' (as discussed in the class). You are allowed to use any language. Your program should input the required probability 'p' and return the number of students (k). You should submit a single zip package containing the source code and a README file that describes how the code can be run. You can do the project in a team with at most 5 members (including you).

## How to run:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the file "CS203_Assignment2.cpp" is present.
2. Write the following two lines in the terminal:

```
g++ -o test CS203_Assignment2.cpp
./test
```

## What the program does?
We have used binary search on the value of k. To calculate and compare the probability for a value of k with p, we have used 2 methods.
1. Using direct formula (as discussed in class)
2. Using Stirling's Approximation (as discussed in class)

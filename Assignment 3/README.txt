Instructions to run the code:

1. Extract the files from the zip file.
2. Open terminal in the unzipped folder, i.e., the folder containg the python file (CS203assignment_3.py).
3. Write the following command on terminal -
	python3 CS203assignment_3.py
4. The code will ask to enter the number of doors, cars and number of trials for calculating the required probabilities. Enter these correctly, then press enter.
5. The code will print the two probabilities for the given set of n, k, number of trials.
6. Then the code will ask to enter the number of doors, cars and number of trials for plotting P(win|switch) / P(win|stay) ratio. Enter these correctly, then press enter.
7. Now the code will show the plot for the given values of n, k and num_trials using 2 libraries: plotly.graph_objects and matplotlib.

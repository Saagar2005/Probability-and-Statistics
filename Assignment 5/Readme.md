Instructions to run the code:

1. Extract the files from the zip file.
2. Open terminal in the unzipped folder, i.e., the folder containg the python file (CS203assignment_5.py).
3. Make sure you have the following python libraries installed on your system: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, ipywidgets and IPython.
3. Write the following command on terminal -
	python3 CS203assignment_5.py
4. The code will show the posterior probability density plots for all four cases of prior beliefs (beta). The plots also have MLE and MAP estimates shown on each of them.
5. Additionally, the fifth plot is shown which can be used to observe changes in the posterior beliefs as our priors change. It has a slider for a and b, which can be adjusted (or typed in the provided boxes) and the corresponding change will be reflected in the plot.

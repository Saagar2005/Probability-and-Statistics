# Simulation of Bertrandâ€™s Paradox

Simulate the three strategies (as discussed in the class) to estimate the probabilities obtained by each of the three sampling strategies. You are allowed to use any language and random sampler. You should submit a single zip package containing the source code and a README file that describes how the code can be run. You can do the project in a team with at most 5 members (including you).

# Instructions to run the code:

1. Extract the files from the zip file.
2. Open the terminal in the unzipped folder, i.e., the folder containing the python file (CS203_Assignment_1.py).
3. Write the following command on the terminal -
	python3 CS203_Assignment_1.py
4. The code will ask to enter the number of chords for simulation. Enter a positive integer, then press enter.
5. Probabilities estimated using the three methods of sampling will be displayed on the terminal. Also, graphs and plots for each method will be generated.
